# HazardDetection

## Key Roles
### • Computer Vision & 3D Reconstruction Engineers: Experts in SfM (using tools like COLMAP/OpenMVG/Open3D) to handle image calibration and 3D model generation.
### • AI/ML Engineers: Focused on deep learning for hazard detection (e.g., working with PointNet or 3D CNNs).
### • Software Engineers: To integrate the pipeline into a robust system (backend, APIs, UI/UX for visualization).
### • Data Engineers: To manage datasets and ensure proper data pipelines and storage (e.g., using cloud storage and spatial databases).
### • Product Manager: To align technical work with market needs and customer feedback.
