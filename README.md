# HazardDetection

## Key Roles
• Computer Vision & 3D Reconstruction Engineers: Experts in SfM (using tools like COLMAP/OpenMVG/Open3D) to handle image calibration and 3D model generation.

• AI/ML Engineers: Focused on deep learning for hazard detection (e.g., working with PointNet or 3D CNNs).

• Software Engineers: To integrate the pipeline into a robust system (backend, APIs, UI/UX for visualization).

• Data Engineers: To manage datasets and ensure proper data pipelines and storage (e.g., using cloud storage and spatial databases).

• Product Manager: To align technical work with market needs and customer feedback.

## Technological Architecture
• 3D Reconstruction: Evaluate COLMAP, OpenMVG/OpenMVS, and Open3D.

• AI Frameworks: Choose between PyTorch or TensorFlow based on team expertise.

• Data Management: Decide on cloud storage and database systems (for spatial data) that integrate with our pipeline.

• Visualization: Explore tools for 3D visualization (e.g., WebGL, Open3D, or even Unity for a more immersive UI).

## 1. Data Acquisition and Dataset Preparation
Capture Multi-Angle Images:

• Use a calibrated camera (or multiple cameras) to capture high-resolution images of the environment from various angles.

• Ensure sufficient overlap between images (a key requirement for multi-view reconstruction).

Data Annotation (Optional at This Stage):

• If you already have known hazards (e.g. water leaks), annotate their location in the images or later on in the reconstructed 3D model.

• Consider using tools like LabelImg (for images) or tools that work with point clouds/meshes for 3D annotation.

Dataset Organization:

• Organize images with metadata (camera intrinsics, GPS or known reference points if available) that can help with calibration and reconstruction.

## 2. 3D Reconstruction from 2D Images
Camera Calibration & Feature Extraction:

• Use algorithms such as SIFT/ORB (available in OpenCV) to detect and match features across images.

• Calibrate camera(s) if necessary, to get accurate intrinsics.

Structure from Motion (SfM):

• Use an SfM library or pipeline (e.g., COLMAP, OpenMVG) to estimate the camera poses and produce a sparse point cloud.

• These tools automatically match features across images, compute relative positions, and output camera parameters.

Dense Reconstruction / Multi-View Stereo (MVS):

• Convert sparse point cloud into a dense 3D model. Tools like OpenMVS or COLMAP’s dense reconstruction can help.

• Alternatively, recent deep learning methods (e.g., Neural Radiance Fields or NeRF) can be explored if you need photorealistic reconstructions.

Model Representation:

• Decide on a final representation: point cloud, mesh, or voxel grid. This decision will impact next steps for hazard detection.

• Tools/libraries such as Open3D (Python) can help you visualize and process these 3D models.

## 3. AI Model Training for Hazard Detection
Data Preparation for AI:

• Convert the 3D model into a format suitable for AI.

• If you work with point clouds, consider using point cloud deep learning networks (e.g., PointNet, PointCNN).

• For a voxel-based approach, convert the model to a 3D grid and use 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Model Architecture and Training:

• Design or select a network architecture that can learn to recognize hazards within the 3D data.

• Create a training pipeline (using frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow) that feeds in labeled examples.

• Augment dataset if needed, for example by synthetically adding examples of water leakage.

Validation:

• Set aside a portion of dataset for validation.

• Ensure that the model learns spatial relationships (i.e., can pinpoint a hazard’s location) rather than just classify images.

## 4. Hazard Localization and Output Coordinates
Inference Pipeline:

• Integrate trained model into a pipeline that processes a new 3D model.

• The model should output not only a detection (e.g. “water leakage detected”) but also the corresponding coordinates in the 3D space.

Coordinate Transformation:

• If needed, map the output coordinates from 3D model back to the real-world coordinate system.

• This might involve using the calibration parameters from the reconstruction stage.
